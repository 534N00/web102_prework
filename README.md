* [🗸] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
Updated CSS to make the site better proportioned in the header, and added a fixed navbar,

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It wasn't the easiest to guesswork CSS to doing what I wanted with so many tools that
can be use to do similar things. It also would have been better if I had features like hover-checking
variables in JS like I can in other languages with propper extentions or just using an IDE.
